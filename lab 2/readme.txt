This directory contains a single main program (in tests.adb) that allows users
to interactively test various capabilities of the NXT.  For example, you can
drive motors and see low-level values for sensors, play a series of tones, use
the BlueTooth facility, and so on.

Control is via the buttons.  Press the orange Power button to exit the current
level of menu, including the top level.  The Left and Right buttons move the cursor
(indicated by a '*') to select a menu entry.  The Middle button invokes the entry 
currently selected.
